        <h1>Improved Strength and Power</h1>
<p>
 Boxing is the ultimate full body workout. Correctly thrown punches use your legs, hips, glutes, core, obliques, back, 
 shoulders, chest and arms. Punching against resistance causes all of these muscles to contract with more force and speed,
 developing further your strength and power.

        <h1>Improved Co-ordination and Body Awareness</h1>
<p>
Moving lots of parts at the same time requires a good connection between your brain and your body.
With patience and practice, focus and discipline can transfer over to other sports and activities.

        <h1>Improved Confidence and Self-Esteem</h1>
<p>
Mastering the techniques involved in boxing often make people feel pretty good! The better your technique,
the more force you can put into your punch. The noise you hear when you land a strong,
accurate punch right on the sweet spot of the focus pad is so satisfying!

<h3>SHADOW BOXING</h3>
    <img src="img/adult-athlete-black-and-white-163403.jpg" alt="shadow" width="40%" height="80%">
<div class="ex-1">
<h4>Define a Goal</h4>
<P>A great shadow boxing workout incorporates a handful of benefits. 
If you mentally highlight specific goals you want to improve on you will see faster results.
For example:
</P>
<ul style="list-style: none">
<li>Enhance your conditioning and endurance</li>
<li>Work on speed and footwork</li>
<li>Simulate defensive or offense movements</li>
<li>Incorporate head movement, slips and fakes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Have a Refernce Point</h4>
<p>
Shadow boxing is as much a mental exercise as a physical one. 
There are many ways to visualize your rounds during shadow boxing.
</p>
<ul style="list-style: none">
<li>Imagine a fighter in front of you</li>
<li>Picture a physical confrontation with another person</li>
<li>Mentally draw an octagon in front of your feet. You will use the octagon to step in, out and around during your combinations</li>
</ul>
<h4>Decide On Duration</h4>
<ul style="list-style:none">
<li>Amateur boxing lasts 3 rounds. These last 2-3 minutes include interval breaks of 1 minute in between. These are uninterrupted.</li>
<li>Timers can include basic stopwatches, cell phone timers, youtube videos or even a trainer to help shout out time.</li>
<li>Before starting your timer for 3 minutes, begin visualizing the upcoming rounds. This not only will help with execution, 
but prepare your body for what upcoming movements and techniques you want to improve on.</li>
<li>Lastly, think about your energy output. If you are just beginning, don’t worry about speed or volume. 
These things are built on a solid foundation of fundamentals that start with honing the basics of technique and visualization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>HEAVY LIFTING</h3>
    <img src="img/active-athlete-barbell-2261477.jpg" alt="barbell" width="40%" height="80%">
<div class="ex-1">
<h4>Build Your Brain</h4>
<p>
Heavy weights develop more than just muscle. Lifting heavy increases the production of many hormones, 
including the hormone IGF-1, which helps to stimulate connections in the brain and enhance cognitive function. In a recent study Trusted Source, 
leg strength was positively linked with stronger minds that are less susceptible to the negative effects of aging.
<br>
Simply stated: Strength training can improve your ability to learn and think as you age.
</p>
<h4>Get stronger</h4>
<p>
Heavy weights increase the power and strength of your muscles without significantly adding bulk or size, 
especially for women. This means that everyday physical tasks get easier, 
and consistent training will increase the amount of weight you can lift. You’ll look stronger,
too. Strength training with heavy weights enhances your muscle mass and definition.
</p>
<h4>Improve endurance</h4>
<p>
It seems counterintuitive, but strength training has been shown to improve enduranceTrusted Source, speed, 
and running economyTrusted Source (the amount of energy and effort it takes to do something like run a five-minute mile). 
A recent study showed that lifting heavier weights improves economy more than lighter weights. 
That extra weight on the bar will pay off during your next run or spin class.
<br>
So don’t lighten on the weights. The heavier the better.
</p>
<h4>Confidence</h4>
<p>
It’s not just me. Training with heavy weights is shown to improve your self-confidence. 
Weight training can also reduce anxietyTrusted Source, ease depressionTrusted Source, and increase happiness.
While it might be hard at times to get motivated to hit the gym, the benefits outlast the initial struggle.

<h3>JOGGING</h3>
    <img src="img/beach-enjoyment-fit-1390403.jpg" alt="jogging" width="40%" height="80%">
<div class="ex-1">
<h4>It improves your cardiovascular fitness</h4>
<p>
Aerobic exercise like jogging improves your body’s ability to deliver oxygen to your muscles.
It also helps your muscles to become more efficient at using that oxygen.
The more you exercise it,
the better your heart works,
and this reduces the risk of a heart attack.
</p>
<h4>It helps to build strong, healthy bones</h4>
<p>
Weight-bearing exercise like jogging puts your bones under stress,
so your body responds by increasing your bone mineral density to make your bones stronger. 
This makes them less likely to break, and helps to keep osteoporosis at bay.
</p>
<h4>It improves mental fitness</h4>
<p>
Jogging and other physical activity can lead to the release of endorphins, 
the chemicals in the brain that produce a sense of happiness and wellbeing. 
It can also help relieve stress and can improve your confidence and self-esteem.
</p>
<h4>It can help with weight-loss</h4>
<p>
Jogging is a great way of burning fat. If you weigh 65-70kg you’ll burn up to 335 kilojoules for every kilometre you run. 
So if you jog 5km four times a week, that’s up to 6700 kilojoules you’re burning each week.
</p>
<h4>It may help you to sleep better</h4>
<p>
Doing cardiovascular exercise such as jogging – particularly in the morning – may set your body clock 
so that you are wide awake during the day and sleepy at night. Plus it may help you to relax and go to sleep more easily.
